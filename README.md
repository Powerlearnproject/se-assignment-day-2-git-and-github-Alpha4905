## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
vision control is a system that tracks changes to code, documents or other digital content over time. it helps to travk changes, collaborate, backup, branching and merging. GitHub is a  popular tool for merging code on the grounds that it hosts repositories, provide collaboration tools, offers version control, supports open source projectsand integrates with other tools. 
maintaining project integrity. version  control helps maintain integrity in the following aspects 
preventing code loss, reverting changes, detcting conflicts auditing changes and enforcing consistency. 
by using version control qnd tools like GitHub you can ensure that your project's sodebaseremains organized, stable and maintainable overtime.
